A NULL pointer points to memory that doesn't exist.
This may be address 0x00000000 or any other implementation-defined value (as long as it can never be a real address).
Dereferencing it means trying to access whatever is pointed to by the pointer.
The * operator is the dereferencing operator:

int a, b, c; // some integers
int *pi;     // a pointer to an integer

a = 5;
pi = &a; // pi points to a
b = *pi; // b is now 5
pi = NULL;
c = *pi; // this is a NULL pointer dereference

This is exactly the same thing as a NullReferenceException in C#,
except that pointers in C can point to any data object, even elements inside an array.
